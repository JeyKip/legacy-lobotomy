# Legacy Lobotomy

Legacy Lobotomy is the wild journey of a development team determined to make sense of an unruly legacy project.
The project is our quirky experiment to transform an outdated and messy codebase into a modern marvel. With equal parts 
creativity and technical finesse, we'll slice through the tangled mess, simplifying and optimizing every line. Join us 
as we tame the code beast and bring order to the chaos!

## Branches

Each branch in the repository represents the current state of the project corresponding to a specific tutorial.
This structure enables readers to easily follow each tutorial step-by-step. Each branch contains the results of the
respective tutorial and serves as the base branch for the subsequent tutorial. For example,
the [initial-codebase](https://github.com/JeyKip/legacy-lobotomy/tree/initial-codebase) branch serves as the starting 
point for the [Running the Project](https://github.com/JeyKip/legacy-lobotomy/wiki/Running-the-Project) tutorial.
The [running-the-project](https://github.com/JeyKip/legacy-lobotomy/tree/running-the-project) branch contains the outcomes
of all the steps in the [Running the Project](https://github.com/JeyKip/legacy-lobotomy/wiki/Running-the-Project) tutorial
and serves as the base branch for the [Multi Environment Configuration](https://github.com/JeyKip/legacy-lobotomy/wiki/Multi-Environment-Configuration)
tutorial, and so forth.
